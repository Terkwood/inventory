# Inventory

This webapp is designed to help track inventory related to 12-step programs.

It is designed so that it does not leak any data to the internet.  That said, your data is stored in _browser localstorage_, in an _unencrypted format_.  So please do not assume that this app is "secure."

Nevertheless, as long as you have control of your device and feel confident that it hasn't been compromised by malicious, third-party apps, you can expect this app to honor privacy.

This app will _never_ transmit your data to any other website, server, or collection facility.
