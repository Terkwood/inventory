## Designed for Privacy

It does not leak any data to the internet. That said, your data is stored in _browser localstorage_, in an _unencrypted format_. So please do not assume that this app is entirely secure: its security depends on the configuration of _your_ device.

Nevertheless, as long as you have control of your device and feel confident that it hasn't been compromised by malicious, third-party apps, you can expect this app to honor privacy.

This app will _never_ transmit your data to any other website, server, or collection facility.

## 4th Step
